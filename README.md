<h1 align="center">Welcome to Fetch Application (Android) ðŸ‘‹</h1>

The Fetch Application is an android application for displaying the items list based on listID and listName.

## Demo
An android native application depending on the platform you applied for that retrieves the data from [https://fetch-hiring.s3.amazonaws.com/hiring.json](https://fetch-hiring.s3.amazonaws.com/hiring.json). The application displays this list of items to the user based on the following requirements
-  Display all the items grouped by "listId"
-  Sort the results first by "listId" then by "name" when displaying.
-  Filter out any items where "name" is blank or null.
